  rabbitmq:
    # There is a prebuilt RabbitMQ image; see
    # https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/ for details.
    # This variant is built on Alpine Linux (it's smaller) and includes
    # the management UI.

    # These ports are exposed on the host; 'hostport:containerport'.

    # DNS name or IP address and port 5672 (the left-hand side of the

    # Run this container on a private network for this application.
    # This is necessary for magic Docker DNS to work: other containers
    # also running on this network will see a host name "rabbitmq"
    # (the name of this section) and the internal port 5672, even though
    # that's not explicitly published above.

      # The location of the RabbitMQ server.  "amqp" is the protocol;
      # "rabbitmq" is the hostname.  Note that there is not a guarantee

      # try multiple times to get around this ordering issue.

    # magic Docker DNS name.
